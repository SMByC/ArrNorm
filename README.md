# ArrNorm

ArrNorm is a command line program for apply the radiometric normalization to the target image based on reference image using the IR-MAD algorithm to locate invariant/variant pixels for a relative radiometric normalization.

The algorithm takes advantage of the linear and affine invariance of the Multivariate alteration detection (MAD)
transformation to perform a relative radiometric normalization of the images involved in the transformation, using the correlation of the iteratively reweighted MAD (IR-MAD) [1]

Stop condition is set by max iteration or with a minimum no-change probability threshold. With more iterations the algorithm try to find a better match to the reference image, decreasing the delta, the plugin select the best delta for the final result. However, after several iterations the changes in the delta are imperceptible.

<figcaption>Fig.1 - Example of a Landsat image normalization, using a multi-year average (reference) to normalize a scene. Those pixel changes are because, some remote sensing imagery pixel values are affected by different causes such as: sensor angle, sun position, clouds and seasons. Be sure that you are using the same 'style' for all layers in Qgis (use copy/paste style for that) to visualize and check the normalization visually.</figcaption>

## Installation

For example with Anaconda/Conda environment:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge gdal numpy scipy matplotlib
pip install https://github.com/SMByC/ArrNorm/archive/master.zip
```

## Parameters

* **-ref** *reference image*: The reference image to normalize the target image.
* **-p** *number of threads*: Number of threads to process several files at the same time (default: 1).
* **-i** *max iterations*: Maximum number of iterations (default: 10).
* **-m** *create mask*: Create a mask file with the valid data (default: False).

For other parameters check the help:

```bash
$ arrnorm -h
```

Examples:

```bash
$ arrnorm -ref reference.tif target.tif
```
```bash
$ arrnorm -i 15 -p 3 -ref reference.tif target01.tif target02.tif target03.tif
```
